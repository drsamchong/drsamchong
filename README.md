### Hello!

I'm Sam, a research chemist working on developing methods for analysing and modelling chemical data.

I lead a team of researchers who use **machine learning** and **optimisation methods** to draw insights about the structure of functional materials. 

Alongside this, we also work on developing **robotic lab workflows** that will open up the potential of **digital chemistry** for materials discovery.

It is important that the tools we develop are straightforward for other researchers to use, so they can make the most of the data they have collected and enable them to prioritise the time and resources that they have for experiments.

That is one reason why I work on data science projects in my (sadly limited) spare time, so that we are able to choose appropriate methods and implement them effectively and sustainably. I also just really like learning stuff, coding and working with data!

We are always looking to collaborate on chemical data projects, whether that's with researchers with experimental data problems or those with an interest in applying data science methods to chemical data.

And if you are just looking for someone with a physical/chemical science training and an interest in data science, **please get in touch**.
